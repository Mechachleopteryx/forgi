Installation
============

Download
--------

The source code for the forgi module can be found at github:

https://github.com/ViennaRNA/forgi

To install, just run the usual::

    python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

The easiest way to install all dependencies is by using::

    pip install -r requirenments.txt

Some standard python packages are required:

* numpy + scipy + pandas
* the future package
* networkx


Further more logging_exceptions is required, which we published separately on Pypi

    pip install logging_exceptions



Additional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library can be installed with some of the additional dependencies missing, but will
raise an error, if functions with missing dependencies are called.

These additional dependencies include:

* matplotlib (Needed for `forgi.threedee.visual`, `forgi.visual` and `forgi.projection`)
* Biopython (Needed for `forgi.threedee`)
* pylab (Needed for `forgi.visual.mplotlib`, )
* beautifulsoap4 (Needed for fetching informations about modified residues in pdb files)
* appdirs (Needed for `forgi.threedee`)

Either MC-Annotate or DSSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To convert PDB files into CoarseGrainRNA objects, either MC-Annotate or DSSR is required.

MC-Annotate is available at http://major.iric.ca/MajorLabEn/MC-Tools.html

DSSR is available at http://home.x3dna.org/

You can create a configuration file to decide which of the two programs you want to use.
If no configuration file exists, MC-Annotate will be used.

We use the appdirs package to define the system specific location of the
configuration file. Under Linux it would default to ~/.config/forgi.
Under Linux, you can create the configuration file like this::

  echo '{"PDB_ANNOTATION_TOOL": "MC-Annotate"}' >  ~/.config/forgi/config.json

or::

  echo '{"PDB_ANNOTATION_TOOL": "DSSR"}' >  ~/.config/forgi/config.json
